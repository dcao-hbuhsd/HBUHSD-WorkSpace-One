## Step 1: Select your region

The first thing to set is your region. This sets your time and date automatically so features such as time zones or day and night cycles for night light can work effectively.

## Step 2: Choose your language keyboard


The next screen is the default and secondary keyboard layouts . Here is where you specify what language you want as your keyboard. You can change this at any time.

## Step 3: Choose your Second Keyboard Layout

## Step 4: Join a Network

Join a network that has internet access. Location does not matter. If you are on campus, you can connect to:

    WiFi Name: HBUHSD-BYOD
    WiFi Password: hbuhSD#education!


## Step 5: Sign into your Microsoft Account

On the Sign in with Microsoft screen, type your HBUHSD Microsoft Account. This should be the same email as your gmail. An example would be jsmith@hbuhsd.edu.

On the Enter your password screen, type your Microsoft account password. Note, this could be different from what you use to log into Gmail. If you are unsure, please contact the IS HelpDesk for assistance. (#52 on Office Phones)

**After logging on, there will be one more restart activated from the computer configurations. Please wait until then.** After the restart, log back in and our HBUHSD software package should automatically start downloading. If you are on a hotspot, it is recommended that you find a different source for internet so you don't use up all of your data. You are now all good to go.
