### Step 2: Join a Network

Connect to a Wi-Fi network: Choose the network and enter a password, if necessary.

    WiFi Password: hbuhSD#education!

### Step 7: Location Services

Tick the box for Enable Location Services on this Mac.
This service is important for use with Siri, Maps, Spotlight suggestions, and more. If you don't want Apple to have access to your location, do not tick this box.

### Step 10: Software Installation

Our HBUHSD software package should automatically start downloading. If you are on a hotspot, it is recommended that you find a different source for internet so you don't use up all of your data. You are now all good to go. You can check by clicking into Applications and checking to see if they appear. 

If you see ? icons on your dock, this means that the software has not been installed onto your machine yet. After the software installation gets pushed down and is complete, a restart will fix these ? icons.
